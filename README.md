# Function solver
## Description
This is a program that calculates the solutions of a given functions for a given domain in the real set R where f(x) may equal to zero.

Thanks to Louafi islem (Louafiorx) for helping me with the idea!

## cons
you must open the program and edit the function you want to get its solution, as the idea of inputing right in the terminal is kinda hard
